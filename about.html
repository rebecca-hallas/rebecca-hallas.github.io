        Kia ora! I am a 27-year-old software developer who loves cats and a good cup of tea. I have also recently gotten into yoga and rock-climbing - an incredible feat considering my virtually non-existent athletic ability!</p>

      <p class="tracking-wider text-white font-customtwo text-2xl text-justify m-6">Previously, I worked as a family lawyer. However, like many people, in 2020 I began seriously reconsidering my career. I had always been interested in
        programming, and after a bit of research I made the leap! In May 2021 I graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy’s full-stack web development bootcamp. </p>
      <p class="tracking-wider text-white font-customtwo text-2xl text-justify m-6">
        It is an incredible privilege to be a web developer: over half the world’s population uses the internet, but only a small percentage of people are behind its design and accessibility. My goal is to contribute as much as I can to the tech industry. This industry connects people and has the power to improve lives; there is endless potential for good.</p>
