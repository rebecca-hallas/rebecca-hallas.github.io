# Rebecca Hallas Portfolio

My portfolio is styled like an old-school arcade game, complete with flashing text and Space Invaders sprites.
I was inspired by [Robby Leonardi's Interactive Resume](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/).

It is a static HTML website using: 
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) as the CSS framework; and 
- Some vanilla JavaScript logic (to allow users to select a player and slightly change the website's theme).

The 'high score' Easter egg is a reference to the number of days in a row that I have a green square on my git commit history :)
